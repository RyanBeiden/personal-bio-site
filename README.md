# Personal Bio Site
This site will display my current projects (with links), the technologies I work with and little bit about myself! This is a forever work in progress, but especially right now, as I am building my first web apps, I will be displaying them here for all to see. Currently, projects **1 & 2** are mine.
>*Note: the exisiting projects have not been deployed yet and will link to their Github Repositories for now.*
