    "description": "This project consists of four sections where you can independently change the score of each section through two buttons that will either increase or decrease the points. I used functions that increase or decrease the integer based on the button's click event. My favorite part is the Tamagotchi shape and the responsiveness that was achieved through absolute/relative positioning and breakpoints/media queries.",

    "description": "This project is a basic form where you can add the name and image URL of a bear that will be added to a Brooks River section. Once a new bear is added, you can select if the bear attempted to catch a fish in the river, and then if they successfully caught the fish! There is a counter displaying the total number of fish caught as well as timestamps for each attempt and catch. I used Bootstrap forms timestamps all based on clicks of different buttons. My favorite addition is you cannot have more catches than attempts.",
